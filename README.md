> [!NOTE]
> This project is implementing **_Convex Hull_** in  `Brute Force` and  `Divide and Conquer`  **_algorithms_**.
> 
> Comparing complexities and actual iterations are one of the main goals to achieve optimum solutions for the Convex hull concept.
> Back-end (algorithms implementation) is done in `C++`
> Front-end is implemented in `React` and `Javascript`


> [!TIP]
> Access [the website](https://suee18.github.io/convexHull.github.io/) to visualize the hulls to coordinates you insert via the dynamic graph.

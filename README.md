> [!NOTE]
> This project is about implementing convex hull in BruteForce and Divide and Conquer algorithms.
> Comparing complexities and actual iterations are one of the main goals to acheive optimum solutons for the Convex hull concept.
> Front-end is implemented in react and java script


> [!TIP]
> Access [the website](https://suee18.github.io/convexHull.github.io/) to visualize the hulls to coordinates you insert via the dynamic graph.

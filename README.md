> [!NOTE]
> This project demonstrates  **_Convex Hull_** in  `Brute Force` and  `Divide and Conquer`  **_algorithms_**.
> 
> Comparing complexities and actual iterations are one of the main goals to achieve optimum solutions for the Convex hull concept.
> 
> Back-end (algorithms implementation) is done in `C++`
> 
> Front-end is implemented in `React` and `Javascript`


> [!TIP]
> Access [the website 🌐](https://suee18.github.io/convexHull.github.io/)
>Simply, click on the graph or enter coordinates in the provided input field to visualize the convex hulls generated by the algorithms.
> ### 👾**Features**
> - Dynamic graph visualization of convex hulls based on user-inputted coordinates.
> - Compare the performance of  `Brute Force` and  `Divide and Conquer`  **_algorithms_**.
